At **OMUSO.ORG**, we aim to make classic literature more accessible. Our goal is to create a digital library that not only preserves and offers classics in various languages but also adapts and improves with the latest technologies.

### Our mission is to provide renewed access to classic literature and empower a new generation of readers and developers to explore these literary treasures.

## What We Do

We are developing an accessible platform that, while still expanding, already offers a wide collection of classic literary works. We design comprehensible APIs that facilitate integration with new technologies, always striving for a smooth and intuitive development experience.

## Why We Do It

We believe that classic literature holds timeless value that deserves to be shared universally. We aspire to make these texts easily accessible and enjoyable for both current and future generations. Our goal is to simplify the exploration of these great works, reducing linguistic and technological barriers.

## Open Source

To ensure our digital library evolves and adapts continuously, we have adopted an open-source approach. We believe that by making our code accessible, we not only stay at the forefront of innovation but also invite the community to contribute and improve collectively. This way, we blend the richness of classic literature with modern technology, creating a platform that grows and perfects itself continuously through open collaboration.
